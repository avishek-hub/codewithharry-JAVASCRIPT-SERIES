# codewithharry-JAVASCRIPT-SERIES
This is the complete JavaScript course code and notes. 
Honestly, this is the best JS course on YouTube. Before starting this course, I used to hate JavaScript becuase of the confusing concepts and the use of var, let and const. Now it is my favourite programming language and all the concepts seem to be easy now. #HarryBhai has put a lot of effort in this course, his handwritten notes, the use of Hindi language, the Amazon voucher giveaways and the memes in between just make it easier to learn this language. If you want to learn JavaScript, then you must surely go with this course!
